TallyHome uses city, state or country-wide price growth indices to calculate a current property valuation from a known, historical price or valuation.  Some suburbs or cities rise in value faster than others, so Tally Home works best if you enter a recent valuation for your particular property.  This might be from a valuer, estate agent, or perhaps you bought your house recently, so you know exactly how much it is worth.  There's nothing to stop you putting a higher or lower valuation on the property in the settings screen
