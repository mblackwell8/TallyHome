<h3 id="pageTitle">How does TallyHome work?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>You enter the location and value of your house under the
    settings screen</li>
    <li>TallyHome collects the best house prices indexes for your
    location.  These track how house prices have changed historically
    for your city, state or country.  TallyHome automatically chooses
    the best index or combination of indexes to suit your house
    (although you can adjust this in the advanced settings, if you
    choose to)</li>
    <li>TallyHome calculates an estimated current value using the
    recent price trend</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pageTitle">Tips</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Enter the most relevant geography: TallyHome tracks price
    indexes at the city, state and country level.  If your house is in a
    big city, more than likely we have an index that is perfect for your
    situation.  If you live in a regional or rural area TallyHome may
    rely upon the average of a broader set of indexes - nearby cities,
    the entire state etc.  We think that you'll get the best result if
    you simply enter the closest city or the state or country you live
    in, but if you think another city is better, choose that one.</li>
    <li>Enter the most recent price or valuation: Clearly some
    suburbs or towns experience price increases that are higher than
    others.  TallyHome works best with a fairly recent valuation or
    price, so if you bought your house a while back, enter your best
    guess at its current or recent value, not the price you paid.
    Alternatively, a real estate agent or home valuer may be able to
    provide a current estimate.</li>
    <li>Use the advanced settings: TallyHome has advanced settings
    that provide control over the indexes we include and the forecasting
    basis.  You can change the defaults, which may improve the result
    for your specific circumstances.</li>
</ol>
